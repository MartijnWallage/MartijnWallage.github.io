<h2 About Me</h2>

<p>I study software engineering in C, C++, Git and Bash at 42 Berlin (part of the 42 network). I have loved programming since I was a child. After an academic career in philosophy of language and logic, I now want to make it my profession. As a researcher I have learned to solve complex problems through logical reasoning; as a lecturer I have developed my communication skills. I am excited about developing software in a team.</p>
